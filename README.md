This project provides a powerful and intuitive web interface that allows users to interact with any SQL database using plain English. It leverages the power of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language questions into executable SQL queries, runs them against the database, and returns the answers in a polished, multi-component conversational format.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **Conversational Chat Interface:** Interact with your data through a familiar chat UI that remembers conversation history.
-   **Rich, Structured Responses:** Answers are displayed professionally with the main finding in bold, the raw data in an interactive table, and the generated SQL query in a collapsible section.
-   **Natural Language to SQL:** Converts complex user questions into accurate SQL queries.
-   **Dynamic Schema Loading:** Automatically inspects the connected database at startup, making the application adaptable to any SQL database without code changes.
-   **Dual Architecture:** Built with a robust **FastAPI** backend for logic and a user-friendly **Streamlit** frontend for interaction.
-   **Powered by Cohere:** Utilizes the `command-r-plus` model for advanced language understanding and high-quality query generation.
-   **Professional Debugging:** Integrated with **LangSmith** for end-to-end tracing and monitoring of the entire application pipeline.

## üß† Use Case Examples

Ask complex questions just like you would to a data analyst:

-   *‚ÄúHow many customers are there in the USA?‚Äù*
-   *‚ÄúShow me the top 5 most expensive tracks.‚Äù*
-   *‚ÄúList all albums by the band 'AC/DC'.‚Äù*
-   *‚ÄúWhat is the total revenue for invoice #10?‚Äù*

## üìÅ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hassan97mahmoud/Explore_SQL_DB_by_NL.git
cd Explore_SQL_DB_by_NL
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
code
Bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
code
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root of your project folder. This file stores your secret credentials and is ignored by Git.
code
Env
# .env file

# Get your key from the Cohere Dashboard: https://dashboard.cohere.com/
COHERE_API_KEY="YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY_HERE"

# --- LangSmith Credentials ---
# Get these from https://smith.langchain.com/
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="YOUR_LANGSMITH_API_KEY_HERE"
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="Explore_SQL_DB_by_NL"

# --- Qdrant Vector Database Configuration ---
QDRANT_HOST="YOUR_QDRANT_HOST_URL"
QDRANT_API_KEY="YOUR_QDRANT_API_KEY"

# --- Database Connection String ---
DB_CONNECTION_STRING="sqlite:///Chinook.db"

# --- Streamlit Admin UI Password ---
ADMIN_PASSWORD="admin"
5. Set Up Qdrant and the Database
Qdrant: The easiest way to run Qdrant is with Docker: docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
Database: This project is configured to use the Chinook.db sample database. Ensure this file is in your project directory.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
You need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.
1. Start the Backend Server (Terminal 1):
code
Bash
# Corrected filename
python App3b.py
Wait until you see the message Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
2. Start the Frontend Application (Terminal 2):
code
Bash
# Corrected filename
streamlit run App2f.py
This will open the web application in your browser.
